# Shadowing Task

This repository contains my solution to a coding challenge completed during a shadowing process. It serves as a demonstration of algorithmic problem-solving and code structure.

## The Challenge

**Goal:** [Briefly describe the task here, e.g., "Parse a log file and extract specific error codes" or "Solve the N-Queens problem"]

**Requirements:**
* **Input:** [e.g., JSON file / Console Input]
* **Output:** [e.g., Calculated Integer / Filtered List]

## Implementation

* **Language:** [Python / Java / C#]
* **Approach:** [Brief sentence on logic, e.g., "Used a hash map to track frequency" or "Implemented a recursive DFS"]

## How to Run

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/lukiux354/Shadowing_task.git](https://github.com/lukiux354/Shadowing_task.git)
    ```
2.  Run the solution:
    ```bash
    # Replace with the actual command to run your file
    python main.py
    ```
